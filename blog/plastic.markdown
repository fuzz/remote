# Never Bet Against The Cheap Plastic Solution

(this thread) on Hacker News with additional discussion about colocated versus distributed teams.
Steven Sinofsky wrote [http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2014/12/30/why-remote-engineering-is-so-difficult/](a response to all of those) and this is my response to all of the above.

I have been working in the tech industry for twenty years modulo hiatuses for creative projects.
I have spent roughly half of that time colocated and half of that time distributed. I do not have
data to support what I am about to write; even if data was available there well may not be enough
of it yet. I am very interested in having data about all of this.

Distributed teams are an innovation enabled by technology. Arguments of authority--Google is
not distributed, Facebook is not distributed, ask startup founders why they don't use distributed
teams--are ludicrous. Gather 'round let me tell you about a little thing called disruption.

Wouldn't it be tragic if you got the immigration laws changed and the best programmers in the world
looked at the quality of life in Silicon Valley, gave it the middle finger, and started better
companies wherever they damned well pleased?

Because I have some news for you. Those exceptional programmers are highly intelligent
individuals with significant left- and right-brain activity. They have no interest in your strip
malls and your traffic and your hole where the culture is supposed to be. That's why they are
moving north to San Francisco. But, as you may have noticed, San Francisco is at capacity and is
clearly not a long-term housing solution. I had a job offer in San Francisco earlier this year
and looked to see what a house like the one I have here with my wife and children in Portland. The
closest I could find, which was significantly smaller (though admittedly much fancier), cost
$20,000/month.

I would not call myself a great programmer, but I do have moments
when the Venn diagrams of my experience align on a certain problem, are ignited by a spark
of creativity and the result is something that looks sufficiently like magic that people who
have seen it happen were probably impressed.

In college I saw a guy solve one of those Jumble puzzles in the paper with no hesitation, he just
opened up the page and whizzed through it. I said to myself wow that's a smart fella. A couple of
years later I told the story to our mutual friend Daniel, saying wow I had not realized dude (I cannot
remember his name Rick or something) was so quick with word puzzles--he must be a pretty smart fella.
Twenty years later Daniel is visiting and tells me he ran into Rick a while back. He told Rick
my story about the Jumble and Rick laughed, said he had done the Jumble in a different paper
earlier in the day and was trying to impress me.

But if an exceptional programmer is found surely they would be allowed to work remote.
Right? If they are THAT good?

Steven suggests that colocated teams better serve the corporate good. Perhaps. But maybe, just maybe,
extracting as much life out of workers as possible--please commute fifteen hours a week so our product
(though maybe not your kids) will be more awesome--is not worth a 0.0002% accuracy in the targeting of
bean advertising to flatulent people wearing a Fitbit. Remember when technology was supposed to improve
the quality of our lives, even the lives of the people building said technology?

Harvard recently completed a 75-year study on human (male) happiness. Their conclusion? It is all
about love and warm relationships. Take 15 hours a week times 50 weeks times 20 years that's 15,000
hours--assuming one is awake 16 hours a day that works out to about 3 years of one's life sitting
in traffic. Imagine instead applying those three years to warm relationships.

I, too, remember those initial attempts at outsourcing. We are not
talking about the days of hustlers getting contracts and then trying to staff them with whatever
bodies they could find. This is 2015; we have GitHub, Stack Overflow, job
boards for distributed teams, massive numbers of contributors to open source projects. Today quality
remote workers and companies can find and evaluate each other directly.

The way I see it a lot of this comes down to synchronous versus asynchronous communication. We
started with synchronous communication as it was natural and it has a lot of useful properties. We
built empires on synchronous communication, we developed techniques and processes and hardware
architectures all around this idea of synchronous communication. But as time passed we realized
what a drain of resources it is to always employ synchronous communication so we started looking at
asynchronous communication. Oh no! What a disaster! We designed all the things for synchronous
communication! As technologists how did we approach this problem? Did we dig our heels in and start
screaming for more and more powerful hardware to keep the old ways afloat? Yup. How did that work
out? It gave us a little breathing room but then we had to put on our big kid pants and acknowledge
the reality that we could no longer continue to cram everything into one place and expect it to scale.
We had to make changes. We had to change processes and the way we approach problems. And what happened?
We discovered better ways to do things. Not merely different ways or almost-as-good ways, but better ways.

I believe that a properly-run distributed team has more transparent and less siloed communication
and that that leads to better collaboration. This may be a tortured analogy but I think of it like
Facebook versus Twitter--you may have more friend-to-friend bandwidth on Facebook but on Twitter
everything is open and transparent which leads to insights outside of one's circle of friends and to
the natural formation of groups of collaborators. Before I really "got" Twitter I thought it sounded
like a horrible idea--strangers following me and me following other people just sounded creepy and there
cannot be any depth with this character limit and blah blah blah. It was not until I had to use it for
work that I really got that it was not a pale substitute for Facebook but rather
a genuine advancement in human consciousness and communication. This is also how I feel about
distributed teams.

A well-run distributed team primarily communicates via group text chat like Slack. As much as possible
all communication happens in various channels that can form by team or project or whatever fits best.
Communication happens asynchronously, transparently and is immutably logged. Conversations are never
lost nor forgotten and no one ever need be excluded from the information because they are not present. 
New group members can quickly be brought up to speed on a given topic or issue by referring them to
relevant logs. Cross referencing code commits with tickets and publishing changes either directly to a
group's room or to a "newsfeed" room provides amazing self-documentation. If I want to know why
something was done I can look at the commit, find the ticket and find all the relevant discussion about
that, how the solution was worked out (might have required something beyond just the code, infrastructure
changes or whatever) and whatever else was going on at that time. Sure, colocated teams can do that somewhat,
but there will always be large gaps that require relying on people's memories of events to resolve.
Fitbit > trying to remember what happened. You may say the need for this does not come up very often and you
would be correct, but when it does come up it can save days or even weeks of time. It can be a lifesaver
in time-sensitive situations like production outages. It can help prevent service regressions. As technologists
we love data, we can learn from data, we can use data to improve our processes. Distributed teams
produce more and richer data about themselves and the work they do than colocated teams.

An industry embracing Big Data should 

As technologists we do not write blog posts asking people to please go to gyms because that is the best way
to work out; instead we innovate and build wearables that people can use to monitor and increase their
activity and fitness levels. That is who we are and what we do. We are the cheap plastic solution you should
never bet against.
